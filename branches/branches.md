# Branches guide
Almost everything about branches, including how to use, some conventions and good programming practices.
 
## Getting Started

All projects come with the master branch already created. It is usually used cleanly and you must do the "dirty work" in another branch and then use pull requests

### Creating and pushing new branches

git push origin nameOfBranch| Pushes the branch to github.
git branch 					| List all branches. * represents the current one.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
